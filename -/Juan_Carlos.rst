About Me
========

I code Open Source on `GitHub. <https://github.com/juancarlospaco>`_
I like to think *outside the box* (but I mean it),
so eventually hit the limits of what `CPython <https://python.org>`_ can do,
then used `Cython <https://cython.org>`_, also choke on the boundaries,
then integrated `Nim <https://nim-lang.org>`_ to my workflow, so far is the most productive,
and allows me to implement my ideas into unique software, not seen anywhere else.

- `Fullstack web Framework from scratch with unique features. <https://nimwc.org/login>`_
- `Electron alternative, web technologies based crossplatform GUI Framework, compiles to few Kilobytes file. <https://juancarlospaco.github.io/webgui>`_
- `Compile-time Type-safe Database ORM for PostgreSQL and SQLite, including prepared statements. <https://github.com/juancarlospaco/nim-gatabase#gatabase>`_
- `Compile-time Translation framework that translates unmodified source code with 0 cost at runtime. <https://github.com/juancarlospaco/nim-nimterlingua#nimterlingua>`_.
- `Requests alternative with built-in multi-thread web scrapers and downloaders, 0 dependency. <https://github.com/juancarlospaco/faster-than-requests#faster-than-requests>`_ ,
- `CSV module for Data Science, HTML Table view, faster than Pandas (at the time of writing it). <https://github.com/juancarlospaco/faster-than-csv#faster-than-csv>`_,
- `Recursive os.walk() alternative with Glob patterns, faster than stdlib (at the time of writing it). <https://github.com/juancarlospaco/faster-than-walk#faster-than-walk>`_.
- `Async Libraries for all APIs of OpenStreetMap. <https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Juan_Carlos>`_
- `Online Web Playground with Python syntax, machine code, Abstract Syntax Tree, UML SVG, QR Code, etc. <http://argentina-ni.ml>`_
- `Python PIP alternative, uploads to PYPI (replaces Twine), single file, works on Docker & Alpine.  <https://github.com/juancarlospaco/nim-pypi>`_ ,
- As a social activity, `I started the Nim Argentina community (Spanish, +100 people). <https://t.me/NimArgentina>`_
- `I have some popular Python packages on pypi <https://pypi.org/user/juancarlospaco>`_

I contributed to popular open source projects like
`Peewee <https://github.com/juancarlospaco/peewee-extra-fields>`_,
`Nuitka <https://nuitka.net>`_, Ninja-IDE.

Arch Linux user, previously Debian/Ubuntu.
I can effectively communicate technical information to non-technical people, I like to make things simpler.
I have been coding Python more than 10 years, on small and big companies of the US.
As a self-taught person, for me programming is always learning new things, is an adventure of a lifetime.
