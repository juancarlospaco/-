About Me
========

I like to code Open Source at `GitHub on my spare time, mostly Python and Nim. <https://github.com/juancarlospaco>`_

`I created my own Web Framework from scratch with unique features not seen on other frameworks. <https://nimwc.org/login>`_
To mention a few is the first Web Framework in the world thats
`Self-Firejailing (it Firejails itself), with 2 Factor Authentication by default, Security Hardened by default, <https://github.com/ThomasTJdev/nim_websitecreator#features>`_
still WYSIWYG & Drag'n'Drop for basic pages, and has its own App Store built-in.
Consider that one of my best works.

Arch Linux user, previously Debian/Ubuntu.
I can effectively communicate technical information to non-technical people, I like to make things simpler.
I like to write Documentation, manually or self-documenting, technical or end-user.
As a self-taught person, for me programming is always learning new things, is an adventure of a lifetime.
